<h1>Cybersecurity-Homelab-for-Detection-and-Monitoring</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I approached this Cybersecurity project with the aim to enhance security by implementing proactive surveillance measures.  This homelab gives a comprehensive walk through on the process of configuring, optimizing and securing IT infrastructure. Although this would be at a relatively small scale, the knowledge gained from this can also be applied to real-world enterprises & infrastructures.
