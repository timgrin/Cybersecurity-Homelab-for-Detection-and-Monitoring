<h1>Cybersecurity-Homelab-for-Detection-and-Monitoring</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I approached this Cybersecurity project intending to enhance security by implementing proactive surveillance measures.  This home lab gives a comprehensive walkthrough on configuring, optimizing, and securing IT infrastructure. Although this would be relatively small, the knowledge gained from this can also be applied to real-world enterprises & infrastructures.
